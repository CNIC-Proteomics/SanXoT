Sanson v1.06 is a program made in the Jesus Vazquez Cardiovascular
Proteomics Lab at Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares, used to
generate the similarity graph of a set of categories.

A similarity graph is a graph that shows the relationship between a set of
categories by taking into account how many proteins they share. This is
measured with a variable f such that for categories c1 and c2, we get:

   f(c1, c2) = (#proteins shared by c1 and c2) / (#proteins of c1)
   
for instance:
  * if c1 == c2, we get f(c1, c2) = f(c2, c1) = 1;
  * if c1 and c2 do not share any proteins, we get f(c1, c2) = f(c2, c1) = 0;
  * if c2 is contained in c1, we get f(c1, c2) <= 1, f(c2, c1) = 1, etc

If no f number is given with the parametres (-e), then the program
automatically calculates the best f number, by maximising both the number of
category clusters and the number categories within each cluster.

Sanson needs three input files:

     * a stats file, the outStats file from SanXoT (using the -z command)
     * a higher level list to graph (using the -c command)
     * a relations file (using -r command)

And delivers five output files:

     * the graph in PNG format (default suffix: "_simGraph.png")
     * the DOT language text file used to generate the graph (default suffix:
           "_simGraph.gv")
     * a table showing the clusters generated (default suffix: "_outClusters")
     * the similarity matrix used to generate the graph (default suffix:
           "_outSimilarities")
     * a log file (default suffix: "_logFile")

Usage: sanson.py -z[stats file] -r[relations file] -c[higher level list file] [OPTIONS]

   -h, --help          Display this help and exit.
   -a, --analysis=string
                       Use a prefix for the output files. If this is not
                       provided, then the prefix will be garnered from the
                       stats file.
   -b, --nosubstats    To avoid colouring the boxes according to the proteins
                       that are in the concerning category (in this case, the
                       box is coloured using the Zij of the category, when this
                       information is available in the higher level list to
                       graph, see -c command).
   -c, --list=filename The text file containing the higher level elements whose
                       categories we want to relate. If the first element is
                       not taken, it might help saving the file with ANSI
                       format. If a header is used, then it must be in the form
                       "id>n>Z>FDR" or "id>Z>n" (where ">" means "tab").
   -d, --dotfile=filename
                       To use a non-default name for the text file in DOT
                       language, which is used to generate the graph.
   -e, --similarity=float
                       To override the calculation of the optimal f number (see
                       above for more details).
   -g, --graphformat=string
                       File format for the similarity graph (default is "png").
   -G, --outgraph=filename
                       To use a non-default name for the graph file.
   -l, --graphlimits=integer
                       To set the +- limits of the most intense red/green
                       colours in the graph (default is 6).
   -L, --logfile=filename
                       To use a non-default name for the log file.
   -m, --simfile=string
                       To use a non-default name for the similarity matrix
                       file.
   -N, --altmax=integer
                       Maximum number of lower level elements that the alt text
                       of the higher level node will show per side. For
                       instance, for N = 3, alt text will show all the elements
                       up to six; beyond this, only the first and last three
                       will be shown. (Default is N = 5.) (Note that this will
                       have effect if the SVG format is used.)
   -p, --place, --folder=foldername
                       To use a different common folder for the output files.
                       If this is not provided, the the folder used will be the
                       same as the stats file folder.
   -r, --relfile, --relationsfile=filename
                       Relations file, with identificators of the higher level
                       in the first column, and identificators of the lower
                       level in the second column.
   -s, --outcluster=filename
                       To use a non-default name for the file containg the
                       list of clusters.
   -z, --outstats=filename
                       The outStats file from a SanXoT integration.
