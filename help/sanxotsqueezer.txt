SanXoTsqueezer v0.10 is a program made in the Jesus Vazquez Cardiovascular
Proteomics Lab at Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares, used
mainly to find, while using the Systems Biology triangle, which categories
contain a determined number of proteins that are changing more than an FDR
set by the user.

SanXoTsqueezer needs two input files:

     * a lower level stats file (command -l)
     * a higher (or upper) level stats file (command -u)

And delivers one output file:

     * the list of changing higher level elements (which can be used as
     SanXoTGauss input to depict gaussians of relevant higher level elements).

Usage: sanxotaqueezer.py -l[lower level stats file] -u[upper level stats file] [OPTIONS]

   -h, --help          Display this help and exit.
   -a, --analysis=string
                       Use a prefix for the output files. If this is not
                       provided, then the prefix will be garnered from the
                       stats file.
   -f, --fdr=float     FDR to filter data. Default is 0.05. If -z is used, then
                       the program will filter only by Z.
   -l, --lowerstats=filename
                       The lower level stats input file.
   -L, --logfile=filename
                       To use a non-default name for the log file.
   -n, --minelements=integer
                       The minimum number of lower level elements that a higher
                       level element must include in the stats file. Default
                       is 2 (the minimum).
   -N, --maxelements=integer
                       The maximum number of lower level elements that a higher
                       level element must include in the stats file. Default
                       is 1e6.
   -o, --outputfile=filename
                       To use a non-default file name for the sigmoid table.
   -p, --place, --folder=foldername
                       To use a different common folder for the output files.
                       If this is not provided, the folder used will be the
                       same as the lower stats file folder.
   -u, --upperstats=filename
                       The higher (upper) level stats input file.
   -z, --sigmas=float  Filter by Z (the number of sigmas the higher level
                       element is deviating from the average). Note that by
                       using this option, you will prevent the program from
                       filtering by FDR (see -f).
