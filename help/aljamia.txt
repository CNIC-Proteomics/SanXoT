Aljamia v1.09 is a program made in the Jesus Vazquez Cardiovascular
Proteomics Lab at Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares, used to
convert data in xml tables into a tab-separated values archive.

Aljamia needs an XML input file, and:

     * up to four strings to combine information from the xml field.
        Commands: -i, -j, -k and -l. Usage: -i[FirstScan] -j[Sequence]
        It is possible to combine fields: -i[RAWFileName]-[FirstScan]_[Charge]
        (which would deliver something like "sampleA.raw-1029-3").
        Everything outside brackets will be copied unchanged. Note that the
        fields are case sensitive.
     * the name of the table where these fields are (command -t). Default is
        "peptide_match".

And delivers:

     * an output data file with three columns (id, x, v) suitable to work as
        input for SanXoT.

Usage: aljamia.py -x[xml file] -i[fold field] [-j[weight field] -k[id string], ...] [OPTIONS]

   -h, --help          Display this help and exit.
   -a, --analysis=string
                       Use a prefix for the output files. If this is not
                       provided, then the prefix will be garnered from the data
                       file.
   -A, --allow-operations
                       Allow python-style operations for the indicated fields.
                       Example: having Scan = 900, Charge = 3, and using
                           -i"[Scan]-[Charge]" -j"[Scan]-[Charge]" -A"i"
                       Will return "887" and "900-3" i- and j-fields,
                       respectively. By default, no operations are allowed.
   -d, --allow-duplicates
                       To avoid removal of duplicated relations.
   -f, --filter=string To filter data to import. Use as in these examples:
                       
                           -f"[Charge]==2"
                           -f"[st_excluded]!=excluded", which means
                               st_excluded must NOT be equal to "excluded"
                           -f"[Charge]=2&&[st_excluded]!=excluded", which
                               means charge must be 2, and st_excluded must
                               not be equal to "excluded"
                           -f"[FirstScan]>=1000"
                           -f"[FASTAProteinDescription]~~clathrin", which means
                                FASTAProteinDescription must include "clathrin"
                           -f"[Sequence]!~C", which means
                                Sequence must NOT include "C"
                           -f"[Sequence]!=ABABABABK", which means
                                Sequence must be different than "ABABABABK"
                           -f"!([Sequence]~~C || [Sequence]~~M)", which means
                                Sequence must not (via "!") contain "C" or
                                (via "||") "M". Note you can use parentheses
                           -f"[Sequence]~~C && [Sequence]~~M", wchich means
                                Sequence must contain "C" and (via "&&") "M"
                       
                       Note that the filter is case sensitive.
                       In forthcoming versions filters will be available for
                       numerical operations, but currently the filter doesn't
                       work with conditionals such as [Mass] > 565.2, only for
                       (in)equalities such as [Mass] == 565.2
                       
   -i, --id1=string    Identifier for the first column. XML tags must be in
                       square brackets, while the rest of the text will be kept
                       unaltered. Here are some examples using tags such as
                       "FirstScan", "Charge", "Mass" or "Sequence" or "PTM":
                       
                          "ABCD" -> "ABCD" (no tags -> unchanged, to all rows)
                          "FS[FirstScan]_q=[Charge]" -> "FS2991_q=2"
                          "ABCD-[Charge]" -> "ABCD-3"
                          "ABCD_[Charge]_[Mass]" -> "ABCD_3_578.1684"
                          "[Sequence]_[PTM]" -> "SAPEREAVDEK_15.994915"
                       
                       Note that tags are case-sensitive.
                       
   -j, --id2=string    Identifier for the second column (see -i).
   -k, --id3=string    Identifier for the third column (see -i).
   -l, --id4=string    Identifier for the fourth column (see -i).
   -L, --logfile=filename
                       To use a non-default name for the log file.
   -o, --output=filename
                       To use a non-default name for the output file.
   -p, --place, --folder=foldername
                       To use a different common folder for the output files.
                       If this is not provided, the the folder used will be the
                       same as the input folder.
   -R, --initialrow=integer
                       To set the position of row with headers (default is 1).
   -t, --table=number  To select fields from a table different than QuiXML's
                       peptide_match (which corresponds to the default, 3).
   -x, --input=filename, --filename=filename
                       Input xml or txt (tsv) file.
