SanXoT v2.07 is a program made in the Jesus Vazquez Cardiovascular Proteomics
Lab at Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares, used to perform
integration of experimental data to a higher level (such as integration from
peptide data to protein data), while determining the variance between them.

SanXoT needs two input files:

     * the lower level input data file, a tab separated text file containing
     three columns: the first one with the unique identifiers of each lower
     level element (such as "RawFile05.raw-scan19289-charge2" for a scan, or
     "CGLAGCGLLK" for a peptide sequence, or "P01308" for the Uniprot accession
     number of a protein), the Xi which corresponds to the log2(A/B), and the
     Vi which corresponds to the weight of the measure). This data have to be
     pre-calibrated with a certain weight (see help of the Klibrate program).

     * the relations file, a tab separated text file containing a first column
     with the higher level identifiers (such as the peptide sequence, a Uniprot
     accession number, or a Gene Ontology category) and the lower level
     identifiers within the abovementioned input data file.
     
     NOTE: you must include a first line header in all your files.

And delivers six output file:

     * the output data file for the higher level, which has the same format as
     the lower level data file, but containing the ids of the higher level in
     the first column, the ratio Xj in the second column, and the weight Vj in
     the third column. By default, this file is suffixed as "_higherLevel".
     
     * two lower level output files, containing three columns each: in both,
     the first column contains with the identifiers of the lower level, the
     second column contains the Xinf - Xsup (i.e. the ratios of the lower
     level, but centered for each element they belong to), and the third column
     is either the new weight Winf (contanining the variance of the
     integration) or the former untouched Vinf weight. For example, integrating
     from scan to peptide, these files would contain firstly the scan
     identifiers, secondly the Xscan - Xpep (the ratios of each scan compared
     to the peptide they are identifying) and either Wscan (the weight of the
     scan, taking into account the variance of the scan distribution) or Vscan.
     By default, these files are suffixed "_lowerNormW" and "_lowerNormV".
     
     * a file useful for statistics, containing all the relations of the higher
     and lower level element present in the data file, with a copy of their
     ratios X and weights V, followed by the number of lower elements contained
     in the upper element (for example, the number of scans that identify the
     same peptide), the Z (which is the distance in sigmas of the lower level
     ratio X to the higher level weighted average), and the FDR (the false
     discovery rate, important to keep track of changes or outliers). By
     default, this file is suffixed "_outStats".
     
     * an info file, containing a log of the performed integrations. Its last
     line is always in the form of "Variance = [double]". This file can be used
     as input in place of the variance (see -v and -V arguments). By default,
     this file is suffixed "_infoFile".
     
     * a graph file, depicting the sigmoid of the Z column which appears in the
     stats file, compared to the theoretical normal distribution. By default,
     this file is suffixed "_outGraph".
     
Usage: sanxot.py -d[data file] -r[relations file] [OPTIONS]

   -h, --help          Display basic help and exit.

   -A, --infofile=filename
                       To use a non-default name for the randomised relations
                       file (only applicable when -R is in use).
   -a, --analysis=string
                       Use a prefix for the output files. If this is not
                       provided, then the prefix will be garnered from the data
                       file.
   -b, --no-verbose    Do not print result summary after executing.
   -C, --confluence    A modified version of the relations file is used, where
                       all the destination higher level elements are "1". If no
                       relations file is provided, the program gets the lower
                       level elements from the first column of the data file.
   -d, --datafile=filename
                       Data file with identificators of the lowel level in the
                       first column, measured values (x) in the second column,
                       and weights (v) in the third column.
   -D, --removeduplicateupper
                       When merging data with relations table, remove duplicate
                       higher level elements (not removed by default).
   -f, --forceparameters
                       Use the parameters as provided, without using the
                       Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. Negative variances will
                       be reset to zero (see -F if you do not wish this).
   -F, --forcenegativevariance
                       Same effect as -f, but not correcting negative variance
                       (as using -f, the program will automatically assign
                       variance = 0 if forced variance is negative).
   -g, --no-graph      Do not show the Zij vs rank / N graph.
   -G, --outgraph=filename
                       To use a non-default name for the graph file.
   -l, --graphlimits=integer
                       To set the +- limits of the Zij graph (default is 6). If
                       you want the limits to be between the minimum and
                       maximum values, you can use -l.

                       To use a non-default name for the info file.
   -m, --maxiterations=integer
                       Maximum number of iterations performed by the Levenberg-
                       Marquardt algorithm to calculate the variance. If
                       unused, then the default value of the algorithm is
                       taken.
   -M, --minseed=float To use a non-default minimum seed. Default is 1e-3.
   -o, --higherlevel=filename

   -p, --place, --folder=foldername
                       To use a different common folder for the output files.
                       If this is not provided, the the folder used will be the

                       level in the second column.
   -R, --randomise, --randomize
                       A modified version of the relations file is used, where
                       the higher level elements (first column) are replaced by
                       numbers and randomly written in the first column. The
                       numbers range from 1 to the total number of elements.
                       The second column (containing the lowel level elements)
                       remains unchanged.

   -U, --lowernormv=filename
                       To use a non-default lower level output file name,
                       setting V as weight (default suffix is _lowerNormV).
   -v, --var, --varianceseed=double
                       Seed used to start calculating the variance.
                       Default is 0.001.
   -V, --varfile=filename
                       Get the variance value from a text file. It must contain
                       a line (not more than once) with the text
                       "Variance = [double]". This suits the info file from
                       another integration (see -L).
   -W, --graphlinewidth=float
                       Use a non-default value for the sigmoid line width.

                       Get the higher and lower limits to calculate the limits
                       of the variance (see -w). Default is 0.05.
   -z, --outstats=filename
                       To use a non-default stats file name.
   --tags=string       To define a tag to distinguish groups to perform the
                       integration. The tag can be used by inclusion, such as
                            --tags="mod"
                       or by exclusion, putting first the "!" symbol, such as
                            --tags="!out"
                       Tags should be included in a third column of the
                       relations file. Note that the tag "!out" for outliers is
                       implicit.
                       Different tags can be combined using logical operators
                       "and" (&), "or" (|), and "not" (!), and parentheses.
                       Some examples:
                            --tags="!out&mod"
                            --tags="!out&(dig0|dig1)"
                            --tags="(!dig0&!dig1)|mod1"
                            --tags="mod1|mod2|mod3"
   --emergencyvariance In the case the maximum iterations are reached (see -m),
                       force the seed variance as emergency variance.
   --xlabel=string     Use the selected string for the X label. Default is
                       "Zij". To remove the label, use --xlabel=" ".
   --ylabel=string     Use the selected string for the Y label. Default is
                       "Rank/N". To remove the label, use --ylabel=" ".
